With these changes, we are now even more confident in the future of the Mavia ecosystem and&nbsp;game!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cEicuFdda74M6h4vAZx2dw.png\"></figure><h3>Update #1: Four Included Heroes for Land NFT&nbsp;Owners</h3>\n<p>Heroes play a very important role in Mavia. While they are not required to play the game, Heroes are extremely powerful units that support players in both defense and offense, making their presence on any base essential, especially as players reach higher HQ levels where offensive/defensive strategies become more&nbsp;complex.</p>\n<p>In fact, Heroes are so crucial to the game balance that we believe it is <strong>unfair </strong>to not have access to Heroes at any given time, as their absence on a base or in an army can make defeating Hero-equipped opponents much more difficult.</p>\n<p>However, if all Heroes are optionally-equipped NFTs as they were planned to be originally, then that leaves the possibility for many players to not have access to Heroes for their base. The reasons for this could be that the player may not be able to afford the additional Hero NFTs, or they do not want to go through the extra steps to purchase/rent the&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reason for not buying or equipping them, we do not want any situation where players will not have access to a unit as important as&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>As a result, we have decided to make available to all bases four default Heroes, which will not be NFTs, but instead will be combined with the Land NFT&nbsp;itself.</strong></p>\n<p>This means all Land owners will be getting four Heroes guaranteed packaged-in with their Land NFTs, with no extra NFT purchase required. These four Heroes are not free, and will still require RUBY to be unlocked. Also, these Heroes are unlocked sequentially, depending on the HQ level of the&nbsp;base.</p>\n<p>There will still be many additional Hero NFTs which are not included by default with the Land NFT, but these will be optional and more unique/rare than the four default ones. The benefit of owning these additional Heroes is that they will have different powers, strategies, looks and scarcity compared to the four default&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Default Heroes are not “free”. There will still be a RUBY cost associated with buying and upgrading the default Heroes. However, what has changed is that <strong>access</strong> to these Heroes are guaranteed for all bases, and the Heroes are not trade-able, so there is no chance of losing access to these Heroes in the future. The cost in RUBY of these Heroes will be announced at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote>\n<p>Future Hero NFTs will be distributed to the community in various ways in the future, but at the moment we are no longer planning for a Hero NFT Sale prior to game launch. We believe the focus should remain entirely on Land NFTs, the MAVIA token and the game&nbsp;itself.</p>\n<p>Skins, upgrades and accessories can still be purchased for the four default Heroes just like any other Hero NFT, but the value derived from these upgrades are now added to the Land NFT instead of the individual Hero NFT. This is because the four default Heroes are permanently attached to the Land&nbsp;NFT.</p>\n<p>We have not yet decided which Heroes will be chosen as the four defaults for each base, this will be announced in a later&nbsp;update.</p>\n<p>We are very excited about this change, because it means that all any player needs to begin playing the game is a base, and this base will not require any additional NFTs to compete fairly amongst other players. We have always distanced ourselves from mechanics that may make the game “pay-to-win”, and this change further solidifies this principle.</p>\n<p>There will not be any Statue NFTs which come default with the base, as statues do not enhance offensive/defensive capabilities. Statues enhance the economics of bases (such as gold and oil production), and do not create an unfair advantage in battle against other players, so there is no risk to game balance by keeping all Statues as supplemental and optional attachments to the&nbsp;bases.</p>\n<blockquote>SIDE NOTE: The “Gold Statue NFTs” which can only be earned through soft-staking now have become the only Mavia NFT available to be acquired at the moment other than Land NFTs, making the statues even more desirable. If you have not yet soft-staked your land, you can do so at <a href=\"https://www.mavia.com/staking/soft\">https://www.mavia.com/staking/soft</a>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z32z0ByTrr6k6ZanZ0pnOw.png\"></figure><h3>Update #2: Free-to-Play Model</h3>\n<p>This specific update is perhaps the most important we have ever announced, as it helps our model scale and accelerates our growth in ways we could not do previously with NFTs&nbsp;alone.</p>\n<p>We have always planned on incorporating a free-to-play model into Mavia, but we first had to wait until the in-game RUBY tokenomics were properly balanced and structured for the NFT players, as these players are our current priority, and make up the core of the Mavia ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>Benefits of Incorporation Free-to-Play</h4>\n<p><strong>Benefit #1&hairsp;—&hairsp;Matchmaking: </strong>With a player base of only 10,000 NFT Lands, there exists a difficulty matching up players in the pool. Given that there are 10 HQ levels, and the amount of players distributed across these HQ levels exist on an uneven spectrum, it becomes more difficult to match up players on the higher and lower ends of this spectrum without increasing the matchmaking pool. With a free-to-play player base added to the matchmaking pool, it allows all players to find compatible matches in the battle matchmaking process, and Alliance war matchmaking process.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #2&hairsp;—&hairsp;Scalability: </strong>Many players who cannot afford or gain access to the Land NFTs that wish to play the game are not able to play without a free-to-play model. While it is true increased demand for the game will make Land NFTs more desirable, there is still a fixed limit to the amount of players that can exist in the game at any point in time if the only entrance to the game is via the Land NFTs (buying, renting or partnering). If Mavia is to scale to a large player base, it is essential to incorporate a free-to-play model that allows anyone to enter the game. The F2P model will allow us to scale to a very large player base, without compromising the balance and security of our RUBY tokenomics model.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #3&hairsp;—&hairsp;Revenue: </strong>Free players bring the opportunity to create revenue streams which can help to grow the RUBY economy exponentially. While free-to-play may not receive the same benefits which Land NFT ownership provides, there are still many incentives to compete and climb the ranks in Mavia as a free player, and the thrilling gameplay along with the goal of becoming a top Player/Alliance will create additional revenue streams which fully benefit the RUBY economy. Due to the decentralized structure of the RUBY economy, $MAVIA holders Land NFT players benefit the most from a free-to-play model succeeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #4 —Awareness: </strong>The only path for Mavia to reach mass-adoption is a vibrant community with ways for players of all background to contribute and enjoy. These free players will bring engagement, awareness, content creation, word-of-mouth marketing and many other benefits to the ecosystem that would be easily incorporated via a free-to-play model.</p>\n<h4>How the Free-to-Play Model&nbsp;Works</h4>\n<p>Please note that these rules are subject to change, and may be adjusted or modified before the release of the F2P&nbsp;model.</p>\n<h4>Free-to-Play Limitations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>No “play-to-earn” functionality: </strong>The F2P players will not be considered “play-to-earn”, as there will be no war chest to collect RUBY from defeated opponents. The rewards at the end of any successful attack will be solely Gold and Oil resources, similar to other Web2 base-builder games.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cannot transfer base: </strong>Players will not be able to transfer their base to another player via an NFT or a wallet transfer. This is a feature solely exclusive to NFT&nbsp;players.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cannot incorporate Hero/Statue NFTs: </strong>Free players will have access to Heroes, but they will not be in the form of NFTs. The Heroes will be identical to the four default Heroes as the NFT bases, but will not have access to the NFT Heroes available to Land&nbsp;NFTs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Common/Rare/Legendary bases: </strong>In the free game, there are no such things as land rarity, all land types are the same. All free bases are similar in design, and have no location on the official “Mavia NFT&nbsp;Island”.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Base is not an NFT: </strong>Free players have their accounts synced to a wallet address, but do not own any NFTs related to Mavia. The progress saved is solely attached to their wallet address via our database, and no NFTs are involved in&nbsp;F2P.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Free-To-Play Benefits:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can earn RUBY through tournaments: </strong>Free-to-play players are able to compete in community tournaments, which have RUBY rewards for the top winners. We anticipate the rewards to be much higher than our Web2.0 counterparts offer currently, which provides an increased incentive for F2P players to advance their base and engage in the game. The amount of RUBY earned in these tournaments is limited, and poses no risk to the RUBY model’s long-term growth and sustainability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can join and compete in Alliances alongside NFT players: </strong>Free players will be able to join and form Alliances, even alongside NFT players. Because F2P and NFT players’ bases are identical in balancing, it is fair and encouraged for players to compete alongside each other against other Alliances.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can spend RUBY on consumables, speed-ups, skins and more: </strong>F2P players are able to purchase RUBY and use it in-game for consumables, build/train time speed-ups, rare skins and more (similar to NFT players). Because F2P players do not receive the same increased NFT value for purchases like Land NFT holders do, the in-game RUBY prices may be adjusted for F2P players. Web2.0 games currently receive hundreds of millions/billions of dollars in revenue each year in in-game purchases, and our F2P player base taps into this&nbsp;market.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access to wagered matches: </strong>F2P players are able to compete in wagered matches, creating more engagement and revenue for the RUBY economy. Small RUBY fees are charged on each wagered match, which are immediately burned. The more wagered match volume created within the game, the more RUBY is&nbsp;burned.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Monthly/Quarterly Winners Can Gain Land Whitelist: </strong>F2P players will be offered whitelist allocations for the main Mavia NFT island if they rank in the top-charts of the F2P leaderboards. This allows the most deserving and skilled players to make it to the main NFT island, allowing the “cream of the crop” to grow the NFT player-base.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>View base on explorer: </strong>Players will be able to see their stats, attack history and many other stats similar to NFT players on the Mavia explorer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Other Free-to-Play Notes:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can be attacked by NFT players: </strong>F2P bases can be attacked by NFT players. While they will not have RUBY to steal and raid, the progress earned by NFT players contributes to their challenge progress, which can earn RUBY rewards upon completion. F2P players cannot attack NFT bases, they can only be attacked by other NFT&nbsp;players.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No RUBY war chest: </strong>F2P players do not have a need for a RUBY war chest, as they do not earn RUBY from attacking enemy&nbsp;bases.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Base buildings and troops similar to NFT bases: </strong>The F2P bases have almost identical bases to NFT players, making matchmaking and competitions fair, as the hit points and health is similar. NFT bases do have very different appearances and luck factors, depending on Common/Rare/Legendary status.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>NOTE: The free-to-play model is not expected to be implemented and available to the public until several months after the global launch consisting of only our Land NFT owners. We are aiming for early-2023 for free-to-play to be fully released.</blockquote>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>In summary, free-to-play allows us to onboard hundreds of thousands or even millions of players into the Mavia ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing the RUBY economy and creating a more competitive and balanced player base for all players to&nbsp;enjoy.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XXwmhyhCCg14cMkSLN4clQ.png\"></figure><h3>Update #3: Mavia Land NFT Supply Cap and Future Distribution</h3>\n<h4>10,000 Hard-Cap Implemented for&nbsp;2022</h4>\n<p>One of the most important questions that Land owners have asked relates to the maximum supply of Land NFTs that will exist in Mavia, and the rate at which these lands will be sold/released to the&nbsp;public.</p>\n<p>We initially gave a soft-cap of 100,000 Land NFTs total on the Mavia island. However, more important than the maximum amount of land is the rate at which that land is released.</p>\n<p>We have carefully considered this topic, and we have decided to firstly set a maximum land limit up until the game&nbsp;launch:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>There will be a hard-cap of 10,000 Mavia Land NFTs in total circulation until January&nbsp;2023.</strong></blockquote>\n<p>There will not exist more than 10,000 Mavia Land NFTs until January 2023, as this timeline allows us to keep our player base relatively small and easily testable for the Beta and official game&nbsp;launch.</p>\n<p>At time of writing, there are exactly 8,000 Land NFTs in circulation. Some of the remaining 2,000 plots of land will be distributed to Mavia Elite competition winners, with the remainder distribution method&nbsp;TBD.</p>\n<h4>Future Land Releases (After Jan 2023&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land NFT #10,001+)</h4>\n<p>Now, we will discuss more details on future land releases after January&nbsp;2023.</p>\n<p>In the early stages of Mavia, we did not have a robust free-to-play model in mind as described in Update #2 above, and the game was primarily centered around the NFT players only. This meant that the entire player base consisted entirely of land owners. As a result, if we needed to expand the player base to create more competition and matchmaking options, we would need to release more Land NFTs to the community in order to grow the amount of bases and potential matches in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>However, now that we have integrated a carefully balanced free-to-play model that allows free players to seamlessly integrate with NFT players, we are able to infinitely grow the player base without needing to release more land in order to stabilize the matchmaking.</p>\n<p>This is a big win for the existing NFT holders, and the Mavia ecosystem as a whole. There is now no critical game balancing requirement forcing us to release more land, and we as a DAO are able to decide together in what quantity and form should the future land be released to new&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p>Even though the game no longer depends on new NFT players entering the ecosystem to balance the game and increase the player pool, it is still extremely beneficial to responsibly release additional Land NFTs to the players and grow the Mavia NFT&nbsp;island.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits to releasing Land&nbsp;NFTs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sale proceeds from Land can be paid in Ruby, stimulating the Ruby&nbsp;economy.</li>\n<li>Additional NFT players bring more top-talent and competition to the P2E&nbsp;economy.</li>\n<li>Gaining access to a Land NFT is one of the main incentives for free-to-play players to compete and&nbsp;win.</li>\n<li>Grows the ecosystem as a whole, bringing more awareness, content and activity to the&nbsp;game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, we are now in a position where we are able to slowly release Land NFTs at a rate we all agree is sustainable and responsible.

                    "content": "\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5Mfc13eXNA17Yj9qYikzvA.jpeg\"></figure><h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>We are excited to share these important updates to all of our Mavia Land owners and community members.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will be outlining several major changes and improvements we have made to the Mavia game model, as well as the future rollout of Land NFTs and&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<p>Before diving into the details, we want to note that we have listened very carefully to the community, and we have also discussed the following changes with multiple focus groups consisting of many community members and Land owners to ensure we made the proper decisions. With these changes, we are now even more confident in the future of the Mavia ecosystem and&nbsp;game!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cEicuFdda74M6h4vAZx2dw.png\"></figure><h3>Update #1: Four Included Heroes for Land NFT&nbsp;Owners</h3>\n<p>Heroes play a very important role in Mavia. While they are not required to play the game, Heroes are extremely powerful units that support players in both defense and offense, making their presence on any base essential, especially as players reach higher HQ levels where offensive/defensive strategies become more&nbsp;complex.</p>\n<p>In fact, Heroes are so crucial to the game balance that we believe it is <strong>unfair </strong>to not have access to Heroes at any given time, as their absence on a base or in an army can make defeating Hero-equipped opponents much more difficult.</p>\n<p>However, if all Heroes are optionally-equipped NFTs as they were planned to be originally, then that leaves the possibility for many players to not have access to Heroes for their base. The reasons for this could be that the player may not be able to afford the additional Hero NFTs, or they do not want to go through the extra steps to purchase/rent the&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the reason for not buying or equipping them, we do not want any situation where players will not have access to a unit as important as&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>As a result, we have decided to make available to all bases four default Heroes, which will not be NFTs, but instead will be combined with the Land NFT&nbsp;itself.</strong></p>\n<p>This means all Land owners will be getting four Heroes guaranteed packaged-in with their Land NFTs, with no extra NFT purchase required. These four Heroes are not free, and will still require RUBY to be unlocked. Also, these Heroes are unlocked sequentially, depending on the HQ level of the&nbsp;base.</p>\n<p>There will still be many additional Hero NFTs which are not included by default with the Land NFT, but these will be optional and more unique/rare than the four default ones. The benefit of owning these additional Heroes is that they will have different powers, strategies, looks and scarcity compared to the four default&nbsp;Heroes.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Default Heroes are not “free”. There will still be a RUBY cost associated with buying and upgrading the default Heroes. However, what has changed is that <strong>access</strong> to these Heroes are guaranteed for all bases, and the Heroes are not trade-able, so there is no chance of losing access to these Heroes in the future. The cost in RUBY of these Heroes will be announced at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote>\n<p>Future Hero NFTs will be distributed to the community in various ways in the future, but at the moment we are no longer planning for a Hero NFT Sale prior to game launch. We believe the focus should remain entirely on Land NFTs, the MAVIA token and the game&nbsp;itself.</p>\n<p>Skins, upgrades and accessories can still be purchased for the four default Heroes just like any other Hero NFT, but the value derived from these upgrades are now added to the Land NFT instead of the individual Hero NFT. This is because the four default Heroes are permanently attached to the Land&nbsp;NFT.</p>\n<p>We have not yet decided which Heroes will be chosen as the four defaults for each base, this will be announced in a later&nbsp;update.</p>\n<p>We are very excited about this change, because it means that all any player needs to begin playing the game is a base, and this base will not require any additional NFTs to compete fairly amongst other players. We have always distanced ourselves from mechanics that may make the game “pay-to-win”, and this change further solidifies this principle.</p>\n<p>There will not be any Statue NFTs which come default with the base, as statues do not enhance offensive/defensive capabilities. Statues enhance the economics of bases (such as gold and oil production), and do not create an unfair advantage in battle against other players, so there is no risk to game balance by keeping all Statues as supplemental and optional attachments to the&nbsp;bases.</p>\n<blockquote>SIDE NOTE: The “Gold Statue NFTs” which can only be earned through soft-staking now have become the only Mavia NFT available to be acquired at the moment other than Land NFTs, making the statues even more desirable. If you have not yet soft-staked your land, you can do so at <a href=\"https://www.mavia.com/staking/soft\">https://www.mavia.com/staking/soft</a>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z32z0ByTrr6k6ZanZ0pnOw.png\"></figure><h3>Update #2: Free-to-Play Model</h3>\n<p>This specific update is perhaps the most important we have ever announced, as it helps our model scale and accelerates our growth in ways we could not do previously with NFTs&nbsp;alone.</p>\n<p>We have always planned on incorporating a free-to-play model into Mavia, but we first had to wait until the in-game RUBY tokenomics were properly balanced and structured for the NFT players, as these players are our current priority, and make up the core of the Mavia ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>Benefits of Incorporation Free-to-Play</h4>\n<p><strong>Benefit #1&hairsp;—&hairsp;Matchmaking: </strong>With a player base of only 10,000 NFT Lands, there exists a difficulty matching up players in the pool. Given that there are 10 HQ levels, and the amount of players distributed across these HQ levels exist on an uneven spectrum, it becomes more difficult to match up players on the higher and lower ends of this spectrum without increasing the matchmaking pool. With a free-to-play player base added to the matchmaking pool, it allows all players to find compatible matches in the battle matchmaking process, and Alliance war matchmaking process.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #2&hairsp;—&hairsp;Scalability: </strong>Many players who cannot afford or gain access to the Land NFTs that wish to play the game are not able to play without a free-to-play model. While it is true increased demand for the game will make Land NFTs more desirable, there is still a fixed limit to the amount of players that can exist in the game at any point in time if the only entrance to the game is via the Land NFTs (buying, renting or partnering). If Mavia is to scale to a large player base, it is essential to incorporate a free-to-play model that allows anyone to enter the game. The F2P model will allow us to scale to a very large player base, without compromising the balance and security of our RUBY tokenomics model.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #3&hairsp;—&hairsp;Revenue: </strong>Free players bring the opportunity to create revenue streams which can help to grow the RUBY economy exponentially. While free-to-play may not receive the same benefits which Land NFT ownership provides, there are still many incentives to compete and climb the ranks in Mavia as a free player, and the thrilling gameplay along with the goal of becoming a top Player/Alliance will create additional revenue streams which fully benefit the RUBY economy. Due to the decentralized structure of the RUBY economy, $MAVIA holders Land NFT players benefit the most from a free-to-play model succeeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit #4 —Awareness: </strong>The only path for Mavia to reach mass-adoption is a vibrant community with ways for players of all background to contribute and enjoy. These free players will bring engagement, awareness, content creation, word-of-mouth marketing and many other benefits to the ecosystem that would be easily incorporated via a free-to-play model.</p>\n<h4>How the Free-to-Play Model&nbsp;Works</h4>\n<p>Please note that these rules are subject to change, and may be adjusted or modified before the release of the F2P&nbsp;model.</p>\n<h4>Free-to-Play Limitations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>No “play-to-earn” functionality: </strong>The F2P players will not be considered “play-to-earn”, as there will be no war chest to collect RUBY from defeated opponents. The rewards at the end of any successful attack will be solely Gold and Oil resources, similar to other Web2 base-builder games.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cannot transfer base: </strong>Players will not be able to transfer their base to another player via an NFT or a wallet transfer. This is a feature solely exclusive to NFT&nbsp;players.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cannot incorporate Hero/Statue NFTs: </strong>Free players will have access to Heroes, but they will not be in the form of NFTs. The Heroes will be identical to the four default Heroes as the NFT bases, but will not have access to the NFT Heroes available to Land&nbsp;NFTs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Common/Rare/Legendary bases: </strong>In the free game, there are no such things as land rarity, all land types are the same. All free bases are similar in design, and have no location on the official “Mavia NFT&nbsp;Island”.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Base is not an NFT: </strong>Free players have their accounts synced to a wallet address, but do not own any NFTs related to Mavia. The progress saved is solely attached to their wallet address via our database, and no NFTs are involved in&nbsp;F2P.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Free-To-Play Benefits:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can earn RUBY through tournaments: </strong>Free-to-play players are able to compete in community tournaments, which have RUBY rewards for the top winners. We anticipate the rewards to be much higher than our Web2.0 counterparts offer currently, which provides an increased incentive for F2P players to advance their base and engage in the game. The amount of RUBY earned in these tournaments is limited, and poses no risk to the RUBY model’s long-term growth and sustainability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can join and compete in Alliances alongside NFT players: </strong>Free players will be able to join and form Alliances, even alongside NFT players. Because F2P and NFT players’ bases are identical in balancing, it is fair and encouraged for players to compete alongside each other against other Alliances.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can spend RUBY on consumables, speed-ups, skins and more: </strong>F2P players are able to purchase RUBY and use it in-game for consumables, build/train time speed-ups, rare skins and more (similar to NFT players). Because F2P players do not receive the same increased NFT value for purchases like Land NFT holders do, the in-game RUBY prices may be adjusted for F2P players. Web2.0 games currently receive hundreds of millions/billions of dollars in revenue each year in in-game purchases, and our F2P player base taps into this&nbsp;market.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access to wagered matches: </strong>F2P players are able to compete in wagered matches, creating more engagement and revenue for the RUBY economy. Small RUBY fees are charged on each wagered match, which are immediately burned. The more wagered match volume created within the game, the more RUBY is&nbsp;burned.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top Monthly/Quarterly Winners Can Gain Land Whitelist: </strong>F2P players will be offered whitelist allocations for the main Mavia NFT island if they rank in the top-charts of the F2P leaderboards. This allows the most deserving and skilled players to make it to the main NFT island, allowing the “cream of the crop” to grow the NFT player-base.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>View base on explorer: </strong>Players will be able to see their stats, attack history and many other stats similar to NFT players on the Mavia explorer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Other Free-to-Play Notes:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Can be attacked by NFT players: </strong>F2P bases can be attacked by NFT players. While they will not have RUBY to steal and raid, the progress earned by NFT players contributes to their challenge progress, which can earn RUBY rewards upon completion. F2P players cannot attack NFT bases, they can only be attacked by other NFT&nbsp;players.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No RUBY war chest: </strong>F2P players do not have a need for a RUBY war chest, as they do not earn RUBY from attacking enemy&nbsp;bases.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Base buildings and troops similar to NFT bases: </strong>The F2P bases have almost identical bases to NFT players, making matchmaking and competitions fair, as the hit points and health is similar. NFT bases do have very different appearances and luck factors, depending on Common/Rare/Legendary status.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>NOTE: The free-to-play model is not expected to be implemented and available to the public until several months after the global launch consisting of only our Land NFT owners. We are aiming for early-2023 for free-to-play to be fully released.</blockquote>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>In summary, free-to-play allows us to onboard hundreds of thousands or even millions of players into the Mavia ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing the RUBY economy and creating a more competitive and balanced player base for all players to&nbsp;enjoy.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XXwmhyhCCg14cMkSLN4clQ.png\"></figure><h3>Update #3: Mavia Land NFT Supply Cap and Future Distribution</h3>\n<h4>10,000 Hard-Cap Implemented for&nbsp;2022</h4>\n<p>One of the most important questions that Land owners have asked relates to the maximum supply of Land NFTs that will exist in Mavia, and the rate at which these lands will be sold/released to the&nbsp;public.</p>\n<p>We initially gave a soft-cap of 100,000 Land NFTs total on the Mavia island. However, more important than the maximum amount of land is the rate at which that land is released.</p>\n<p>We have carefully considered this topic, and we have decided to firstly set a maximum land limit up until the game&nbsp;launch:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>There will be a hard-cap of 10,000 Mavia Land NFTs in total circulation until January&nbsp;2023.</strong></blockquote>\n<p>There will not exist more than 10,000 Mavia Land NFTs until January 2023, as this timeline allows us to keep our player base relatively small and easily testable for the Beta and official game&nbsp;launch.</p>\n<p>At time of writing, there are exactly 8,000 Land NFTs in circulation. Some of the remaining 2,000 plots of land will be distributed to Mavia Elite competition winners, with the remainder distribution method&nbsp;TBD.</p>\n<h4>Future Land Releases (After Jan 2023&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land NFT #10,001+)</h4>\n<p>Now, we will discuss more details on future land releases after January&nbsp;2023.</p>\n<p>In the early stages of Mavia, we did not have a robust free-to-play model in mind as described in Update #2 above, and the game was primarily centered around the NFT players only. This meant that the entire player base consisted entirely of land owners. As a result, if we needed to expand the player base to create more competition and matchmaking options, we would need to release more Land NFTs to the community in order to grow the amount of bases and potential matches in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>However, now that we have integrated a carefully balanced free-to-play model that allows free players to seamlessly integrate with NFT players, we are able to infinitely grow the player base without needing to release more land in order to stabilize the matchmaking.</p>\n<p>This is a big win for the existing NFT holders, and the Mavia ecosystem as a whole. There is now no critical game balancing requirement forcing us to release more land, and we as a DAO are able to decide together in what quantity and form should the future land be released to new&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p>Even though the game no longer depends on new NFT players entering the ecosystem to balance the game and increase the player pool, it is still extremely beneficial to responsibly release additional Land NFTs to the players and grow the Mavia NFT&nbsp;island.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits to releasing Land&nbsp;NFTs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sale proceeds from Land can be paid in Ruby, stimulating the Ruby&nbsp;economy.</li>\n<li>Additional NFT players bring more top-talent and competition to the P2E&nbsp;economy.</li>\n<li>Gaining access to a Land NFT is one of the main incentives for free-to-play players to compete and&nbsp;win.</li>\n<li>Grows the ecosystem as a whole, bringing more awareness, content and activity to the&nbsp;game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, we are now in a position where we are able to slowly release Land NFTs at a rate we all agree is sustainable and responsible. In the future, the DAO and Land Owners will help to decide these rates of land releases together.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6f116b63f3e8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/important-mavia-updates-land-nft-supply-free-to-play-heroes-and-more-6f116b63f3e8\">Important Mavia Updates — Land NFT Supply, Free-to-Play, Heroes and more!</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

Once the lockup period is finalized, users will then need to withdraw the NFT from the staking contract (another gas cost $), and then the user will have control over the NFT&nbsp;again.</p>\n<p>We feel that in the case of NFT staking, a simpler solution should exist to reward holders, and soft-staking solves all of these&nbsp;issues.</p>\n<h3>Release Date</h3>\n<p><strong>Land NFT soft-staking will be released for the public officially on Saturday, March 26&nbsp;2022.</strong></p>\n<p>This does not mean you must stake on this date. At the moment, there is no deadline to begin your stake. However, the sooner you begin your stake, the sooner you will earn your rewards (after nine&nbsp;months).</p>\n<h3>Rewards</h3>\n<p><strong>Reward #1: Gold Statue&nbsp;NFT</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pjCxqRUWLEDXUMQfbitjjA.jpeg\"></figure><p>Our first round of soft-staking will require a holding period of nine months, and will reward every Land NFT staked with a “Gold Statue&nbsp;NFT”.</p>\n<p>Each and every Land NFT staked will receive a Gold Statue NFT if they successfully complete their nine month holding period&nbsp;stake.</p>\n<p>At the end of nine months, every user who completed the hold will see the Gold Statue whitelist appear in the minting page of Mavia.com, similar to how the Land was minted. However, this Gold Statue NFT mint is 100% free, and not just a whitelist. The only cost associated will be the gas fee required to mint the&nbsp;NFT.</p>\n<p>The Gold Statue NFT is the first-ever Statue NFT made available to the public. The Statue can be placed on any base, and it will immediately begin improving the Gold production rate of the base. Gold is an essential resource in Mavia, and is used in dozens of buildings for upgrades and constructions, as well as many other things throughout the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>By improving the rate at which you produce Gold, your base can grow stronger and faster. This NFT is very valuable, and will serve immense utility on any Land/Base it is placed&nbsp;on.</p>\n<p>The Statue can be used immediately after it is minted, and after the game is released. The Statue NFT, like other NFTs, will begin at Level 1 and can be upgraded with RUBY to become more powerful and productive.</p>\n<p><strong>Reward #2: Mystery Reward (Rare + Legendary Only)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*__VVkGq5C-BTYqU8LFdLZw.jpeg\"></figure><p>Each Rare or Legendary land staked will receive an <strong><em>additional </em></strong>reward at the end of the nine month holding period. This reward is currently a mystery, and will be revealed closer to the game launch. There will be a slightly better reward for Legendary lands compared to Rare. Common lands are not eligible for the mystery&nbsp;reward.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Users who stake more than one NFT are eligible to receive a reward for each piece of land staked. There is no benefit to separating wallets, and staking across multiple accounts. There is also no benefit to consolidating many lands into a single&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote>\n<p>It is important to remember that if during your stake, you sell or move your NFT from your wallet, you will be immediately disqualified from staking rewards, and will receive no reward for your time staked. Only if you have completed nine consecutive months of holding the NFT in your wallet will you receive the reward(s).</p>\n<h3>How Soft-Staking Works</h3>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Your Land NFTs to&nbsp;Stake</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pYkj8ETUVqo_UK95uyKDLA.jpeg\"></figure><p>The first step to soft-staking is to select the Land NFTs you wish to stake from the staking dialogue. You will be able to stake every Land NFTs owned by your wallet, all for no&nbsp;gas.</p>\n<p>You can stake Common + Rare + Legendary at the same time, in unlimited quantities.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Select “Stake&nbsp;Now”</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZA8d4xR1IB9NppMWpntIg.jpeg\"></figure><p>You will be shown a screen with information with your stake duration, and the rewards you will be earning from your stake. Click the “Stake Now” button to proceed with the&nbsp;stake.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Confirm Your Stake &amp; Optional Whitelist</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KmzQF5PAN6_eL5BEYZvI7Q.jpeg\"></figure><p>A popup will display that gives you some final disclaimers, and the ability to add a whitelisted address.</p>\n<p>You are able to whitelist 2 wallets when you stake your land. The first whitelisted wallet is by default your connect account wallet, this cannot be&nbsp;changed.</p>\n<p>You have the *optional* ability to whitelist a second wallet address also, which could be a hardware wallet such as Trezor or&nbsp;Ledger.</p>\n<p>All whitelisted wallets enable you to transfer to/from them without ending your stake. Non-whitelisted wallets cause an immediate ending of the staking if your Land NFT is sent to&nbsp;it.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: You can add only 1 whitelisted address per stake. This whitelist address (in addition to the default address of your connected account) will NOT end your stake if your NFT is stored in it. This feature was created so users can store their NFTs in Hardware wallets, without ending their&nbsp;stake.</blockquote>\n<p>Once your select the “Continue” button, you will be asked to sign a transaction from your wallet. This will not cost any gas, this simply approves the stake transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Done&hairsp;—&hairsp;Hold Your Land&nbsp;NFTs</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvKndSL5VH_B1pIPiZe4BQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now that you have successfully soft-staked your Land NFT(s), the only thing left to do is hold! By simply keeping your Land NFT in your whitelisted wallet(s), you will continue to be staked. After the nine month period, your reward will be available.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Staking Land still allows you to play the game once it is released. Because you still hold the Land NFT(s) in your wallet, you will be able to play by connecting your wallet to the game, without any consequence to your staking progress. Soft-staking really is like having your cake and eating it&nbsp;too!</blockquote>\n<h3>About Heroes of&nbsp;Mavia</h3>\n<p>Heroes of Mavia is a AAA MMO strategy game allowing players to buy land, build a base and battle other players for the in-game token RUBY. There exists three NFT types in the game&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land, Heroes and Statues, each of which can be bought and sold on the Mavia marketplace. RUBY is the main play-to-earn currency in the game, and can be earned by winning battles against other&nbsp;bases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://skrice.com/\">Skrice Studios&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mavia.com/\">Official Mavia&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/MaviaOfficial\">Mavia Telegram Community</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://discord.gg/maviaofficial\">Mavia Discord Community</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2eaff0b70994\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-land-nft-soft-staking-2eaff0b70994\">Mavia Land NFT Soft-Staking</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

However, the sooner you begin your stake, the sooner you will earn your rewards (after nine&nbsp;months).</p>\n<h3>Rewards</h3>\n<p><strong>Reward #1: Gold Statue&nbsp;NFT</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pjCxqRUWLEDXUMQfbitjjA.jpeg\"></figure><p>Our first round of soft-staking will require a holding period of nine months, and will reward every Land NFT staked with a “Gold Statue&nbsp;NFT”.</p>\n<p>Each and every Land NFT staked will receive a Gold Statue NFT if they successfully complete their nine month holding period&nbsp;stake.</p>\n<p>At the end of nine months, every user who completed the hold will see the Gold Statue whitelist appear in the minting page of Mavia.com, similar to how the Land was minted. However, this Gold Statue NFT mint is 100% free, and not just a whitelist. The only cost associated will be the gas fee required to mint the&nbsp;NFT.</p>\n<p>The Gold Statue NFT is the first-ever Statue NFT made available to the public. The Statue can be placed on any base, and it will immediately begin improving the Gold production rate of the base. Gold is an essential resource in Mavia, and is used in dozens of buildings for upgrades and constructions, as well as many other things throughout the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>By improving the rate at which you produce Gold, your base can grow stronger and faster. This NFT is very valuable, and will serve immense utility on any Land/Base it is placed&nbsp;on.</p>\n<p>The Statue can be used immediately after it is minted, and after the game is released. The Statue NFT, like other NFTs, will begin at Level 1 and can be upgraded with RUBY to become more powerful and productive.</p>\n<p><strong>Reward #2: Mystery Reward (Rare + Legendary Only)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*__VVkGq5C-BTYqU8LFdLZw.jpeg\"></figure><p>Each Rare or Legendary land staked will receive an <strong><em>additional </em></strong>reward at the end of the nine month holding period. This reward is currently a mystery, and will be revealed closer to the game launch. There will be a slightly better reward for Legendary lands compared to Rare. Common lands are not eligible for the mystery&nbsp;reward.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Users who stake more than one NFT are eligible to receive a reward for each piece of land staked. There is no benefit to separating wallets, and staking across multiple accounts. There is also no benefit to consolidating many lands into a single&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote>\n<p>It is important to remember that if during your stake, you sell or move your NFT from your wallet, you will be immediately disqualified from staking rewards, and will receive no reward for your time staked. Only if you have completed nine consecutive months of holding the NFT in your wallet will you receive the reward(s).</p>\n<h3>How Soft-Staking Works</h3>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Your Land NFTs to&nbsp;Stake</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pYkj8ETUVqo_UK95uyKDLA.jpeg\"></figure><p>The first step to soft-staking is to select the Land NFTs you wish to stake from the staking dialogue. You will be able to stake every Land NFTs owned by your wallet, all for no&nbsp;gas.</p>\n<p>You can stake Common + Rare + Legendary at the same time, in unlimited quantities.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Select “Stake&nbsp;Now”</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZA8d4xR1IB9NppMWpntIg.jpeg\"></figure><p>You will be shown a screen with information with your stake duration, and the rewards you will be earning from your stake. Click the “Stake Now” button to proceed with the&nbsp;stake.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Confirm Your Stake &amp; Optional Whitelist</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KmzQF5PAN6_eL5BEYZvI7Q.jpeg\"></figure><p>A popup will display that gives you some final disclaimers, and the ability to add a whitelisted address.</p>\n<p>You are able to whitelist 2 wallets when you stake your land. The first whitelisted wallet is by default your connect account wallet, this cannot be&nbsp;changed.</p>\n<p>You have the *optional* ability to whitelist a second wallet address also, which could be a hardware wallet such as Trezor or&nbsp;Ledger.</p>\n<p>All whitelisted wallets enable you to transfer to/from them without ending your stake. Non-whitelisted wallets cause an immediate ending of the staking if your Land NFT is sent to&nbsp;it.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: You can add only 1 whitelisted address per stake. This whitelist address (in addition to the default address of your connected account) will NOT end your stake if your NFT is stored in it. This feature was created so users can store their NFTs in Hardware wallets, without ending their&nbsp;stake.</blockquote>\n<p>Once your select the “Continue” button, you will be asked to sign a transaction from your wallet. This will not cost any gas, this simply approves the stake transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Done&hairsp;—&hairsp;Hold Your Land&nbsp;NFTs</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvKndSL5VH_B1pIPiZe4BQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now that you have successfully soft-staked your Land NFT(s), the only thing left to do is hold! By simply keeping your Land NFT in your whitelisted wallet(s), you will continue to be staked. After the nine month period, your reward will be available.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Staking Land still allows you to play the game once it is released. Because you still hold the Land NFT(s) in your wallet, you will be able to play by connecting your wallet to the game, without any consequence to your staking progress. Soft-staking really is like having your cake and eating it&nbsp;too!</blockquote>\n<h3>About Heroes of&nbsp;Mavia</h3>\n<p>Heroes of Mavia is a AAA MMO strategy game allowing players to buy land, build a base and battle other players for the in-game token RUBY. There exists three NFT types in the game&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land, Heroes and Statues, each of which can be bought and sold on the Mavia marketplace. RUBY is the main play-to-earn currency in the game, and can be earned by winning battles against other&nbsp;bases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://skrice.com/\">Skrice Studios&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mavia.com/\">Official Mavia&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/MaviaOfficial\">Mavia Telegram Community</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://discord.gg/maviaofficial\">Mavia Discord Community</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2eaff0b70994\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-land-nft-soft-staking-2eaff0b70994\">Mavia Land NFT Soft-Staking</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

This will allow you to stand out from other non-landowners in the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Discord Channel: </strong>All landowner roles will also be granted access to a private channel on the Mavia Discord server, where devs and landowners can all discuss together new ideas and help shape the direction of the Mavia&nbsp;game.</p>\n<h3>Different Land&nbsp;Types</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*315D2mC0VuVaQPSHmI7zew.png\"></figure><p><strong>Common: </strong>Common land makes up 70% of the Mavia Island NFTs (consistent for all regions of island). Common land has all of the same functionality and utility as Rare and Legendary, except the appearance is less lavish and the location on the map is not in prime areas. No defensive/offensive differences exist between any of the land types, nor do their sizes&nbsp;differ.</p>\n<p><strong>Rare: </strong>Rare land makes up 20% of the Mavia Island NFTs. Rare has a more luxurious design than the common, and also has a more desirable location on the land map itself. Additionally, Rare land has extra luck factor included when removing obstacles, which over time will prove to be very valuable!</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary: </strong>Legendary land makes up just 10% of the Mavia Island NFTs. Legendary has the most luxurious design out of all land types, and also has the highest luck factor when removing obstacles, as well as the peak location on the Mavia map. In the case of the Tropical type, Legendary has waterfront beach location.</p>\n<h3>Land Uses and&nbsp;Utility</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4dpy4QxnP0rMhMDL\"></figure><p>In Mavia, <strong>land</strong> is the most valuable asset. Initially, all land starts out with a <strong>Level 1 Base</strong>. As players develop their land and re-invest RUBY into upgrading their Base HQ level and building their walls, troops and other defensive structures, the land improves in value. As the base grows stronger, the <strong>value of the land increases</strong>, creating multiple options for potential monetization by the&nbsp;owner:</p>\n<p><strong>1: Playing the Mavia&nbsp;game</strong></p>\n<p>The owner of the land can use the base they own to battle other bases and players across the island of Mavia, and compete for RUBY. As the base increases in strength, the player can <strong>battle stronger opponents</strong>, also yielding <strong>higher rewards</strong> in the event of&nbsp;victory.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Selling Base on Mavia Marketplace</strong></p>\n<p>The owner of the base can sell the land on the Mavia marketplace for MAVIA token, passing down all of the progress made on the base to the new owner. Once a base or it’s buildings are upgraded, they will always remain that level or higher, making it <strong>permanently more valuable</strong>. There will be “<strong>Buy it Now</strong>” and “<strong>Auction</strong>” style sales available.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Renting out&nbsp;base</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the<strong> “AirBnB” model</strong>, base owners are able to <strong>rent out their base</strong> according to a range of dates and a price set by the owner. The tenant of the base will pay upfront MAVIA to the owner, but will in turn be able to earn and keep all of the RUBY generated from using the base. This includes RUBY won from battling opponents, successful defensive battles, completing challenges, finding rare items, and other events which earn players RUBY. The owner of the base will not benefit from this RUBY being generated by the player, but will instead be generating passive income in the form of MAVIA from the rental agreement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the owner of the base will benefit from the base structures being improved or <strong>upgraded by the tenant</strong>, such as walls and turrets. The tenant will be inclined to upgrade these base structures, as they do not require RUBY, but instead only Gold and Oil, and upgrading these structures helps the base succeed in defending from invaders.</p>\n<p><strong>4: Base Partnerships</strong></p>\n<p>Partnerships are a good way for new players to enter the Mavia world, requiring no MAVIA payment upfront. Similar to Axie Infinity’s Scholarship program, <strong>Base Partnerships</strong> allow a base owner to lend their land to another player, expecting the player to use the base, continue to grow the army and improve the base, and also battle other players, yielding RUBY rewards. In return for this work done by the player, the base owner will keep a <strong>fixed % of the RUBY</strong> earnings, as an <strong>owner’s fee</strong>. The RUBY split is decided by the owner before the partnership is formed, and can be adjusted as time goes on, at the owner’s discretion.</p>\n<p>The RUBY proceeds are <strong>automatically distributed</strong> to the player and owner immediately upon any RUBY earnings being realized in the game. This model also makes it possible for skilled players to demand a higher RUBY split form the owner, as their gameplay will likely yield higher earnings than newer or less-skilled players. On the flip-side, players who are new to the game and looking to work for RUBY in the form of a partnership will likely accept less of a split from the owner, in order to build up a name for themselves in the Mavia&nbsp;game.</p>\n<h3>Land Reveal</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*FDvD0Zp-R61nipOYa4avSw.gif\"><figcaption>Example of our Mavia land (basic woodlands region) with varying designs and unique fingerprinting, making each land NFT unique in look and location. This is not the same design as the tropical, this is displayed to illustrate the subtle differences between each land&nbsp;plot.</figcaption></figure><p>Each land has a unique location on the map, as well as a unique&nbsp;design.</p>\n<p>However, designing 8,000 functional bases each with a unique design and location on a realistic looking map takes some time! We are building the flows and tools to be able to render these lands individually for players when they build their base, attack neighbors, or defend against invaders.</p>\n<p>This design process will be complete in Q3 2022, and it is at this time that we will reveal to everyone their individual base&nbsp;designs!</p>\n<h3>Land Owner&nbsp;Roadmap</h3>\n<p><strong>March Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Land Soft-Staking Launched</li>\n<li>Tier-1 Partnership Announcements</li>\n<li>First-Ever Mavia Cinematic Trailer Release(end of March or early&nbsp;April)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MAVIA Token&nbsp;Launch</li>\n<li>Hero and Statue NFT&nbsp;Drops</li>\n<li>Gameplay footage</li>\n<li>Constant updates, sneak peeks and community events</li>\n<li>More cinematic trailers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game beta released for land&nbsp;owners</li>\n<li>E-sports team division formed (tournaments and marketing)</li>\n<li>Much more to be announced!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Global game&nbsp;launch</li></ul>\n<h3>Land Soft-Staking Mechanics and&nbsp;Rules</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*frhoncjyfdIkPT8n\"></figure><p><strong>How It&nbsp;Works</strong></p>\n<p>Mavia Land Soft-Staking is a brand new staking model created to give more flexibility and control to our players, while also rewarding strong hands with rewards in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>Soft-staking means Land owners can stake Land without their NFT ever actually leaving their wallet. Users simply press the “Stake” button, and our Backend will begin watching the associated wallet and ensuring the NFT never leaves or is sold on a secondary market.</p>\n<p>The holder will agree to a specific stake duration (6–12 months), and only after this time has passed with the staker receive the reward, as long as they did not transfer or sell the NFT from their&nbsp;wallet.</p>\n<p>Because this process is entirely off-chain, there is no gas fee associated with staking/un-staking.</p>\n<p>The entire process will be accessible on Mavia.com when it is released (later this month in March&nbsp;2022).</p>\n<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>\n<p>We have not officially announced the rewards for soft-staking, but we can say this for&nbsp;now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common, Rare and Legendary will receive different rewards (or Rare and Legendary will receive additional rewards than common). This is another way for us to deliver value to our higher-end land holders, while remaining fair to all&nbsp;stakers.</li>\n<li>We are considering offering Hero and Statue NFTs for stakers (this will require gas to mint the reward, but not to stake the&nbsp;land).</li>\n<li>We will add the ability to whitelist 1 other wallet when you stake, to give you the chance to move your NFT to a hardware wallet or other cold storage wallet without breaking your stake. Any transfer to a non-whitelisted wallet results in your stake being terminated.</li>\n<li>Land staking rewards and details will be announced on March 12,&nbsp;2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gas-Free Utility</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xLExurVLcBi8tbAk.jpeg\"></figure><p>Since we began designing and developing Mavia, we have always put user-experience at the top of our priority&nbsp;list.</p>\n<p>We want to create an environment with as little friction as possible for new players to enter Mavia. And gas fees are the biggest hurdle when it comes to blockchain games remaining low-friction.</p>\n<p>Our solution is simple: move as much game logic as possible off-chain.</p>\n<p>We have designed the servers and platform itself to only require you to hold an NFT, and the rest will be taken care of by us. All battles, in-game RUBY transactions and earnings, tournaments and upgrades will all occur off-chain. As long as you hold Mavia Land in your wallet, you do not need to do anything else&hairsp;—&hairsp;and that means you do not have to pay any additional gas to use Mavia after you own the&nbsp;Land.</p>\n<p>Even when Land owners form partnerships with other players, no gas needs to be paid by either party. All logic will be handled by us, gas-free!</p>\n<h3>Mavia Alliances</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NCspbdxQYhT25MPk1Q41Zg.jpeg\"></figure><p>Perhaps one of the most alluring aspects of the Mavia game is the ability to forge alliances with other players, and battle rival Alliances to compete for NFTs, RUBY rewards and&nbsp;glory!</p>\n<p>However, we do not want you to wait until the game comes out for you to begin forging these Alliances, so we are building our the functionality to form your own Alliances with other land owners in March! All land owners who soft-stake their land will have the ability to join or create an Alliance, which will have additional perks and functionality prior to game launch as&nbsp;well!</p>\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\n<p>Please be cautious of scammers looking to steal your valuable land. Bad actors will make Mavia look-alike UI and website and try and trick you into interacting with their smart contracts which can end up resulting in you losing your Mavia&nbsp;land!</p>\n<p>ALWAYS make sure the URL you are visiting is Mavia.com before interacting with any smart contracts, or signing any transactions.</p>\n<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>\n<p>We are extremely excited to build Mavia with our community, and we will continue to share updates on all developments, designs and project plans with all of our land&nbsp;owners!</p>\n<p>If you have not already, follow Mavia on our socials to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HeroesofMavia\">Mavia YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/heroesofmavia/\">Mavia Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/maviaofficial\">Mavia Discord</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gaming/MaviaOfficial\">Mavia Facebook</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d087f065e8dd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-land-owner-manual-roadmap-benefits-and-more-d087f065e8dd\">Mavia Land Owner Manual&hairsp;—&hairsp;Roadmap, Benefits and More!</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

This will allow you to stand out from other non-landowners in the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Discord Channel: </strong>All landowner roles will also be granted access to a private channel on the Mavia Discord server, where devs and landowners can all discuss together new ideas and help shape the direction of the Mavia&nbsp;game.</p>\n<h3>Different Land&nbsp;Types</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*315D2mC0VuVaQPSHmI7zew.png\"></figure><p><strong>Common: </strong>Common land makes up 70% of the Mavia Island NFTs (consistent for all regions of island). Common land has all of the same functionality and utility as Rare and Legendary, except the appearance is less lavish and the location on the map is not in prime areas. No defensive/offensive differences exist between any of the land types, nor do their sizes&nbsp;differ.</p>\n<p><strong>Rare: </strong>Rare land makes up 20% of the Mavia Island NFTs. Rare has a more luxurious design than the common, and also has a more desirable location on the land map itself. Additionally, Rare land has extra luck factor included when removing obstacles, which over time will prove to be very valuable!</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary: </strong>Legendary land makes up just 10% of the Mavia Island NFTs. Legendary has the most luxurious design out of all land types, and also has the highest luck factor when removing obstacles, as well as the peak location on the Mavia map. In the case of the Tropical type, Legendary has waterfront beach location.</p>\n<h3>Land Uses and&nbsp;Utility</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4dpy4QxnP0rMhMDL\"></figure><p>In Mavia, <strong>land</strong> is the most valuable asset. Initially, all land starts out with a <strong>Level 1 Base</strong>. As players develop their land and re-invest RUBY into upgrading their Base HQ level and building their walls, troops and other defensive structures, the land improves in value. As the base grows stronger, the <strong>value of the land increases</strong>, creating multiple options for potential monetization by the&nbsp;owner:</p>\n<p><strong>1: Playing the Mavia&nbsp;game</strong></p>\n<p>The owner of the land can use the base they own to battle other bases and players across the island of Mavia, and compete for RUBY. As the base increases in strength, the player can <strong>battle stronger opponents</strong>, also yielding <strong>higher rewards</strong> in the event of&nbsp;victory.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Selling Base on Mavia Marketplace</strong></p>\n<p>The owner of the base can sell the land on the Mavia marketplace for MAVIA token, passing down all of the progress made on the base to the new owner. Once a base or it’s buildings are upgraded, they will always remain that level or higher, making it <strong>permanently more valuable</strong>. There will be “<strong>Buy it Now</strong>” and “<strong>Auction</strong>” style sales available.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Renting out&nbsp;base</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the<strong> “AirBnB” model</strong>, base owners are able to <strong>rent out their base</strong> according to a range of dates and a price set by the owner. The tenant of the base will pay upfront MAVIA to the owner, but will in turn be able to earn and keep all of the RUBY generated from using the base. This includes RUBY won from battling opponents, successful defensive battles, completing challenges, finding rare items, and other events which earn players RUBY. The owner of the base will not benefit from this RUBY being generated by the player, but will instead be generating passive income in the form of MAVIA from the rental agreement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the owner of the base will benefit from the base structures being improved or <strong>upgraded by the tenant</strong>, such as walls and turrets. The tenant will be inclined to upgrade these base structures, as they do not require RUBY, but instead only Gold and Oil, and upgrading these structures helps the base succeed in defending from invaders.</p>\n<p><strong>4: Base Partnerships</strong></p>\n<p>Partnerships are a good way for new players to enter the Mavia world, requiring no MAVIA payment upfront. Similar to Axie Infinity’s Scholarship program, <strong>Base Partnerships</strong> allow a base owner to lend their land to another player, expecting the player to use the base, continue to grow the army and improve the base, and also battle other players, yielding RUBY rewards. In return for this work done by the player, the base owner will keep a <strong>fixed % of the RUBY</strong> earnings, as an <strong>owner’s fee</strong>. The RUBY split is decided by the owner before the partnership is formed, and can be adjusted as time goes on, at the owner’s discretion.</p>\n<p>The RUBY proceeds are <strong>automatically distributed</strong> to the player and owner immediately upon any RUBY earnings being realized in the game. This model also makes it possible for skilled players to demand a higher RUBY split form the owner, as their gameplay will likely yield higher earnings than newer or less-skilled players. On the flip-side, players who are new to the game and looking to work for RUBY in the form of a partnership will likely accept less of a split from the owner, in order to build up a name for themselves in the Mavia&nbsp;game.</p>\n<h3>Land Reveal</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*FDvD0Zp-R61nipOYa4avSw.gif\"><figcaption>Example of our Mavia land (basic woodlands region) with varying designs and unique fingerprinting, making each land NFT unique in look and location. This is not the same design as the tropical, this is displayed to illustrate the subtle differences between each land&nbsp;plot.</figcaption></figure><p>Each land has a unique location on the map, as well as a unique&nbsp;design.</p>\n<p>However, designing 8,000 functional bases each with a unique design and location on a realistic looking map takes some time! We are building the flows and tools to be able to render these lands individually for players when they build their base, attack neighbors, or defend against invaders.</p>\n<p>This design process will be complete in Q3 2022, and it is at this time that we will reveal to everyone their individual base&nbsp;designs!</p>\n<h3>Land Owner&nbsp;Roadmap</h3>\n<p><strong>March Roadmap:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Land Soft-Staking Launched</li>\n<li>Tier-1 Partnership Announcements</li>\n<li>First-Ever Mavia Cinematic Trailer Release(end of March or early&nbsp;April)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MAVIA Token&nbsp;Launch</li>\n<li>Hero and Statue NFT&nbsp;Drops</li>\n<li>Gameplay footage</li>\n<li>Constant updates, sneak peeks and community events</li>\n<li>More cinematic trailers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game beta released for land&nbsp;owners</li>\n<li>E-sports team division formed (tournaments and marketing)</li>\n<li>Much more to be announced!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Global game&nbsp;launch</li></ul>\n<h3>Land Soft-Staking Mechanics and&nbsp;Rules</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*frhoncjyfdIkPT8n\"></figure><p><strong>How It&nbsp;Works</strong></p>\n<p>Mavia Land Soft-Staking is a brand new staking model created to give more flexibility and control to our players, while also rewarding strong hands with rewards in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>Soft-staking means Land owners can stake Land without their NFT ever actually leaving their wallet. Users simply press the “Stake” button, and our Backend will begin watching the associated wallet and ensuring the NFT never leaves or is sold on a secondary market.</p>\n<p>The holder will agree to a specific stake duration (6–12 months), and only after this time has passed with the staker receive the reward, as long as they did not transfer or sell the NFT from their&nbsp;wallet.</p>\n<p>Because this process is entirely off-chain, there is no gas fee associated with staking/un-staking.</p>\n<p>The entire process will be accessible on Mavia.com when it is released (later this month in March&nbsp;2022).</p>\n<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>\n<p>We have not officially announced the rewards for soft-staking, but we can say this for&nbsp;now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common, Rare and Legendary will receive different rewards (or Rare and Legendary will receive additional rewards than common). This is another way for us to deliver value to our higher-end land holders, while remaining fair to all&nbsp;stakers.</li>\n<li>We are considering offering Hero and Statue NFTs for stakers (this will require gas to mint the reward, but not to stake the&nbsp;land).</li>\n<li>We will add the ability to whitelist 1 other wallet when you stake, to give you the chance to move your NFT to a hardware wallet or other cold storage wallet without breaking your stake. Any transfer to a non-whitelisted wallet results in your stake being terminated.</li>\n<li>Land staking rewards and details will be announced on March 12,&nbsp;2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gas-Free Utility</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xLExurVLcBi8tbAk.jpeg\"></figure><p>Since we began designing and developing Mavia, we have always put user-experience at the top of our priority&nbsp;list.</p>\n<p>We want to create an environment with as little friction as possible for new players to enter Mavia. And gas fees are the biggest hurdle when it comes to blockchain games remaining low-friction.</p>\n<p>Our solution is simple: move as much game logic as possible off-chain.</p>\n<p>We have designed the servers and platform itself to only require you to hold an NFT, and the rest will be taken care of by us. All battles, in-game RUBY transactions and earnings, tournaments and upgrades will all occur off-chain. As long as you hold Mavia Land in your wallet, you do not need to do anything else&hairsp;—&hairsp;and that means you do not have to pay any additional gas to use Mavia after you own the&nbsp;Land.</p>\n<p>Even when Land owners form partnerships with other players, no gas needs to be paid by either party. All logic will be handled by us, gas-free!</p>\n<h3>Mavia Alliances</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NCspbdxQYhT25MPk1Q41Zg.jpeg\"></figure><p>Perhaps one of the most alluring aspects of the Mavia game is the ability to forge alliances with other players, and battle rival Alliances to compete for NFTs, RUBY rewards and&nbsp;glory!</p>\n<p>However, we do not want you to wait until the game comes out for you to begin forging these Alliances, so we are building our the functionality to form your own Alliances with other land owners in March! All land owners who soft-stake their land will have the ability to join or create an Alliance, which will have additional perks and functionality prior to game launch as&nbsp;well!</p>\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\n<p>Please be cautious of scammers looking to steal your valuable land. Bad actors will make Mavia look-alike UI and website and try and trick you into interacting with their smart contracts which can end up resulting in you losing your Mavia&nbsp;land!</p>\n<p>ALWAYS make sure the URL you are visiting is Mavia.com before interacting with any smart contracts, or signing any transactions.</p>\n<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>\n<p>We are extremely excited to build Mavia with our community, and we will continue to share updates on all developments, designs and project plans with all of our land&nbsp;owners!</p>\n<p>If you have not already, follow Mavia on our socials to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HeroesofMavia\">Mavia YouTube</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/heroesofmavia/\">Mavia Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/maviaofficial\">Mavia Discord</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gaming/MaviaOfficial\">Mavia Facebook</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d087f065e8dd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-land-owner-manual-roadmap-benefits-and-more-d087f065e8dd\">Mavia Land Owner Manual&hairsp;—&hairsp;Roadmap, Benefits and More!</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

Mavia will no longer send out any emails to any of our community members.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Introduction:</h3>\n<p>The first Land NFT mint is set to begin on Friday, March 4 at 10:00 AM EST (NYC&nbsp;Time).</p>\n<p>In order to better prepare the whitelisted community members and other users who wish to participate in the public NFT sale phase of the mint, we have created this guide to show you ahead of time what the UI and flow is for the mint on Mavia.com</p>\n<p><strong>There are two phases of the mint&nbsp;process:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Whitelist Sale&hairsp;—&hairsp;</strong>This phase lasts 72 hours, and is the first phase of the mint sale. All pre-sale and whitelisted users can mint their allocation guaranteed during this time period, with no fear of “gas wars” or any race to mint. However, if users fail to mint their allocation during this period, then their allocation will be moved to the “Public Sale”&nbsp;phase.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Sale&hairsp;—&hairsp;</strong>This phase of the land sale allows any user to mint up to 5 common, 5 rare and 5 legendary lands each. This phase is designed to sell out quickly, and users may find themselves fighting with others rapidly to purchase the leftover land from the whitelist sale. This phase begins exactly 72 hours after the begin of the mint (Monday, March 7 @ 10:00 AM&nbsp;EST).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 1: Create&nbsp;account</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*wBFpV3oA7IPm_tF_7y47og.gif\"></figure><p>The first step is to create your Mavia account. All you need to do in order to create an account is connect your supported Cryptocurrency wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>Supported wallets&nbsp;include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MetaMask (including hardware wallets via MetaMask)</li>\n<li>TrustWallet</li>\n<li>Coinbase Wallet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you connect your wallet, you will need to choose your username. Your username can be changed&nbsp;anytime.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: This username will be used inside of the game and publicly displayed for various staking/game events.</blockquote>\n<p>After you choose your Mavia username, simply fill the captcha anti-bot form and then hit “Create Account”.</p>\n<p>You will also be asked to sign your signature using your wallet. This is to confirm your wallet ownership, and does not call any functions on a smart contract.</p>\n<p>If successful, you should see the “Account was created”&nbsp;popup.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Navigate to mint&nbsp;screen</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BVg4N3t0nhC1q6f0xot9rg.png\"></figure><p>The first place you want to go after you create an account is the “NFTs” page located in the header navigation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rj4BNafc1K9Cqw_A3MUwfQ.png\"></figure><p>Once you go on this screen, you will see a box which says “Land NFTs” below, this is the Land NFT mint. Click “View Land” to navigate to the mint&nbsp;screen.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Mint your Land&nbsp;NFTs</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*i2ZDXV-Knbu2jUZpW9Jc_w.gif\"></figure><p>Once you arrive on the mint screen, you will be shown the Common, Rare and Legendary land boxes. Each box can only mint its respective land&nbsp;type.</p>\n<p>Depending on your whitelist, you may only be able to mint a single type of land, or you may be able to mint some from each&nbsp;type.</p>\n<blockquote>NOTE: Minting more than 1 NFT in a single transaction is possible using our UI, and it saves gas costs also. However, you can only mint a single Land NFT type at a&nbsp;time.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f-cwtCYNu7AJwAaAALRrIQ.png\"><figcaption>If you are whitelisted for multiple NFTs of the same type (≥2 Common, ≥2 Rare or ≥2 Legendary), you can press “MAX” on the mint popup to mint your maximum allocation amount in a single transaction</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2QNmBdTaCxLvHpVHwdoWeQ.png\"></figure><p>After you pay the fee and confirm the transaction in your wallet, the mint transaction will be initiated.

This framework and architecture we build is scalable and will be used for all of our future NFT mints, and is extremely dynamic.</p>\n<p>Land owners can look forward to soft-staking which will be released shortly after the Land Mint, as well as many other perks which are to be announced soon!</p>\n<h3>About Heroes of&nbsp;Mavia</h3>\n<p>Heroes of Mavia is a AAA MMO strategy game allowing players to buy land, build a base and battle other players for the in-game token RUBY. There exists three NFT types in the game&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land, Heroes and Statues, each of which can be bought and sold on the Mavia marketplace. RUBY is the main play-to-earn currency in the game, and can be earned by winning battles against other&nbsp;bases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://skrice.com/\">Skrice Studios&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mavia.com/\">Official Mavia&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/MaviaOfficial\">Mavia Telegram Community</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://discord.gg/maviaofficial\">Mavia Discord Community</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=62d1c0e67d2c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-nft-minting-walkthrough-62d1c0e67d2c\">Mavia NFT Minting Walkthrough</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

Users will have to participate in this stage in order to qualify for buying a Land NFT. During this stage, users must demonstrate they are holding at least 0.1 BNB in their wallets in order to verify they are active users. Users will be able to see their average BNB holding on the staking dashboard 24 hours after the preparation stage begin (it takes 24 hours for the data to get refreshed). The average BNB holding will be calculated on hourly basis. Therefore, we strongly suggest users to hold at least 0.1 BNB before the preparation stage begin and to hold down to those BNB until the preparation stage&nbsp;end.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Subscription Stage:</strong> All eligible users will move on to stage two, aka the subscription stage. During the subscription stage, users will be able to purchase NFT tickets with ETH. Each ticket is the same price as the Common Land NFT, and Binance has capped the maximum at 2 tickets per user. User will be able to choose if they want to subscribe to two tickets or just one. (The more tickets they hold, the higher chance they will get to be selected as winners). The subscription stage will begin on 3/2 2AM UTC and will close on 3/3 9AM&nbsp;UTC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Calculation Stage:</strong> The third stage, aka the calculation stage, is for Binance to calculate all tickets and to randomly select winners. The final stage will begin on 3/3 12pm UTC with the NFT distribution to winning&nbsp;tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important: </strong>Each step is very time-sensitive, so please prepare ahead. Users will not be able to participate if the time window closes for any given&nbsp;stage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Preventing Scams:</strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HY2btTfeQXrlW23D.png\"><figcaption>Make sure to bookmark Mavia.com to prevent getting tricked into minting on a scam clone of Mavia’s&nbsp;website.</figcaption></figure><p>There are many scammers looking to trick our users into “minting” NFTs on their clone look-alike website, which will only result in users sending their funds to a&nbsp;scammer.</p>\n<p>Please bookmark the Mavia.com website, and ensure you only mint your whitelist on our official site. We will NEVER have another website you can mint/stake NFTs on, only ever on Mavia.com</p>\n<p>Scammers may try to reach out to you through Telegram, Discord or through email trying to get you to visit a fake website or trick you into giving your private seed&hairsp;—&hairsp;always ask a Mavia Moderator on Discord if you are ever&nbsp;unsure!</p>\n<h3>Mavia Land Benefits and&nbsp;Roadmap:</h3>\n<p>There are many benefits to owning Land in Mavia, and the full list of these will be shown in another&nbsp;post.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to show the roadmap and plans we have for Land NFTs, to give our Land Owners an idea of what they can expect from their&nbsp;Land.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Mint: </strong>The first major milestone is the Land mint, described in this&nbsp;post.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land-Owner Discord Group: </strong>The same day as the official mint, there will be a land-owners only group set up on Discord, creating an exclusive community within Mavia. The development team will be extra engaged with this&nbsp;group.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Staking: </strong>Land staking allows users to soft-stake their land and earn passive rewards simply by not selling their land and holding it in their wallet. $0 in gas fees, and very easy to&nbsp;do!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Reveal: </strong>After the mint date, the second most exciting day for Land owners is the “reveal” of the base design for each NFT owner. Every single Land NFT will be given a unique location on the Mavia island, with a custom-designed look and environment setup for your future base. This image and map location will be revealed in Q3 2022, after our team completes the design, placement and polishing for each plot of&nbsp;land.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Beta Access: </strong>Land owners will gain early access to the game beta, giving them a first-look and at the Mavia game and ecosystem before anyone&nbsp;else.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Several Surprises: </strong>We have several unofficial benefits and surprises waiting in store for our land owners. More information on this will be revealed at a later&nbsp;time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ABOUT MAVIA</h3>\n<p>Mavia is a AAA MMO strategy game allowing players to buy land, build a base and battle other players for RUBY.

We will NEVER have another website you can mint/stake NFTs on, only ever on Mavia.com</p>\n<p>Scammers may try to reach out to you through Telegram, Discord or through email trying to get you to visit a fake website or trick you into giving your private seed&hairsp;—&hairsp;always ask a Mavia Moderator on Discord if you are ever&nbsp;unsure!</p>\n<h3>Mavia Land Benefits and&nbsp;Roadmap:</h3>\n<p>There are many benefits to owning Land in Mavia, and the full list of these will be shown in another&nbsp;post.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to show the roadmap and plans we have for Land NFTs, to give our Land Owners an idea of what they can expect from their&nbsp;Land.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Mint: </strong>The first major milestone is the Land mint, described in this&nbsp;post.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land-Owner Discord Group: </strong>The same day as the official mint, there will be a land-owners only group set up on Discord, creating an exclusive community within Mavia. The development team will be extra engaged with this&nbsp;group.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Staking: </strong>Land staking allows users to soft-stake their land and earn passive rewards simply by not selling their land and holding it in their wallet. $0 in gas fees, and very easy to&nbsp;do!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Land Reveal: </strong>After the mint date, the second most exciting day for Land owners is the “reveal” of the base design for each NFT owner. Every single Land NFT will be given a unique location on the Mavia island, with a custom-designed look and environment setup for your future base. This image and map location will be revealed in Q3 2022, after our team completes the design, placement and polishing for each plot of&nbsp;land.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Beta Access: </strong>Land owners will gain early access to the game beta, giving them a first-look and at the Mavia game and ecosystem before anyone&nbsp;else.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Several Surprises: </strong>We have several unofficial benefits and surprises waiting in store for our land owners. More information on this will be revealed at a later&nbsp;time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ABOUT MAVIA</h3>\n<p>Mavia is a AAA MMO strategy game allowing players to buy land, build a base and battle other players for RUBY. There exists three NFT types in the game&hairsp;—&hairsp;Land, Heroes and Statues, each of which can be bought and sold on the Mavia marketplace for MAVIA token, and the NFTs can only be upgraded by using the RUBY cryptocurrency. RUBY is the main play-to-earn currency in the game, and can be earned by winning battles against other bases. Mavia is currently in development, and the official token launch and game launch dates will be announced at a later date.

The synergies between our game and Team Queso make this partnership a perfect fit, and we look forward to growing together with their&nbsp;team.”</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT MAVIA:</strong></p>\n<p>Heroes of Mavia is a play-to-earn MMO Strategy game developed by Skrice Studios. The game takes place in a fantasy-themed island called Mavia, where players build bases on plots of land and battle neighboring bases and armies to earn in-game resources, such as Mavia’s P2E cryptocurrency RUBY. Players must strategically place defensive buildings on their base such as walls, turrets and traps, in order to defend against opportunistic attackers looking to steal resources. Resources can also be stolen from rival bases through attacking opponents with land troops, vehicle and air units.

Our team has an extensive background competing in Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, and Mavia excites us with its groundbreaking gameplay features and potential to be the first truly disruptive P2E game coming&nbsp;out!”</p>\n<p><strong>What Skrice Studios Had to Say on the Partnership</strong></p>\n<p>Tristan Chaudhry, Managing Director at Skrice Studios, said: “Partnering with such an established and prominent organization like Team Queso is the first milestone in Mavia’s roadmap to become an esports titan in crypto gaming. The synergies between our game and Team Queso make this partnership a perfect fit, and we look forward to growing together with their&nbsp;team.”</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT MAVIA:</strong></p>\n<p>Heroes of Mavia is a play-to-earn MMO Strategy game developed by Skrice Studios. The game takes place in a fantasy-themed island called Mavia, where players build bases on plots of land and battle neighboring bases and armies to earn in-game resources, such as Mavia’s P2E cryptocurrency RUBY. Players must strategically place defensive buildings on their base such as walls, turrets and traps, in order to defend against opportunistic attackers looking to steal resources. Resources can also be stolen from rival bases through attacking opponents with land troops, vehicle and air units. RUBY is earned through battling enemy armies, and can be used to upgrade Land, Statue and Hero&nbsp;NFTs.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Queso&nbsp;Links:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teamqueso.com/\">Team Queso&nbsp;Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamQuesoGG\">Team Queso&nbsp;Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfmUGIBVMlnjGoIm4RY00UA\">Team Queso&nbsp;YouTube</a></p>\n<p><strong>Mavia Links:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mavia.com/\">Mavia Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaviaGame\">Mavia Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HeroesofMavia\">Mavia YouTube</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=81f5e7295600\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-announces-partnership-with-esports-giant-team-queso-81f5e7295600\">Mavia Announces Partnership With Esports Giant Team Queso</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

But almost all games developed to date are owned and controlled fully by the developers, and the players retain little-to-no value they contributed to the game - besides the enjoyment they experienced while&nbsp;playing.</p>\n<p>In many instances, games evolve into large communities that help shape the future vision and direction of the game through content, feedback, testing and input given to the developers, yet the players are not given anything in return for their contributions.</p>\n<p>This is the problem that Web3.0 gaming aims to&nbsp;solve.</p>\n<h3>Play-to-earn in Web3.0&nbsp;Gaming</h3>\n<p>Web3.0 gaming aims to shift the ownership of these ecosystems from the developers to the&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p>Earning through gameplay is nothing new. Almost all Web2.0 games reward players through in-game points, items and achievements.</p>\n<p>Rewarding players is one of the most important mechanics of any modern game, as it incentivizes players to reach a higher skill level, progress through the game, and promotes friendly competition amongst the&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p>However, the player is not able to transfer the game assets they accrued and earned to another player in a user-friendly fashion, and therefore the rewards often become worthless as soon as the player loses interest in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>Through NFTs and creatively structured token models, players are able to enjoy the games they play, while also seeing their contributions made to the ecosystem rewarded, experiencing a new type of control for the assets they build and&nbsp;earn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these new types of games are structured with in-game assets being NFTs, allowing the players to own and control their playable characters, skins and assets anyway they&nbsp;like.</p>\n<p>The ability for a player to own an in-game asset, work towards improving this asset and build upon it, and then ultimately withdraw that game asset in the form of an NFT and exchange it to another player creates a whole new world of opportunity for&nbsp;gamers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mavia Land, Hero and Statue&nbsp;NFTs</strong></h3>\n<p>Land is the primary NFT asset in the game of Mavia. Without Land, players are not able to build and operate a base, and therefore are not able to play the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>Hero and Statue NFTs are optional and are not required to play the game. Both Heroes and Statues enhance the gameplay and help provide a strategic advantage through battle and through base&nbsp;boosts.</p>\n<p>All Lands/Bases start out at a Level 1 HQ, and must be built upon by the player. The value of the land, and the amount of RUBY it is able to produce/earn inside of the game is completely dependent on the&nbsp;player.</p>\n<p>The Mavia development team never promises or suggests that any NFT will increase in value as it relates to ETH, USD or Fiat currencies. The real-life value of any Base/Hero/Statue NFT is irrelevant to the NFT value in the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>What our development team can ensure is the in-game value of the NFT increases with work and effort. When RUBY or other in-game resources are spent on NFT upgrades, NFTs utility inside of the game increases.</p>\n<p>For example, when a Hero is upgraded from a Level 5 to a Level 6, that Hero’s damage and health is now increased permanently.</p>\n<p>But just because an NFTs value inside of the game increases, this does not means that the secondary market value increases as well. Many factors play a role in that, including supply of the NFTs, market conditions, game demand and much&nbsp;more.</p>\n<p>Whether this increase in in-game value translates to a higher secondary market price is outside of the Mavia game is something we have no control over. We have little influence in secondary market prices, all we can aim to provide is the tools to allow our players to utilize their in-game assets any way they like, including trading those NFTs with other&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p>The decision for the supply of bases and other NFTs will be placed into the DAOs control, placing the trust of this key component into the community’s hands. These votes will be held on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</p>\n<h3>The Mavia NFT Marketplace</h3>\n<p>In order to enhance the experience for Mavia players, we have created a feature-rich NFT marketplace that allows players to buy, sell, partner and rent their NFT&nbsp;assets.</p>\n<p>Our marketplace does not have access to any data within the ecosystem that is not already openly-available for all to view. Our public-facing APIs allow anyone to build an equivalent (or even more advanced) marketplace for the Mavia NFTs if they&nbsp;wish.</p>\n<p>The Mavia NFT marketplace is fully decentralized, and the development team never takes custody of any NFT&nbsp;assets.</p>\n<p>Additionally, all transactions within the Mavia NFT Marketplace are exchanged through the MAVIA token, creating even more utility for $MAVIA and further enhancing our internal ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>MAVIA, RUBY and NFT Asset Token Offerings</h3>\n<p>We will not be having any type of public sales for either MAVIA or RUBY&nbsp;tokens.</p>\n<p>The MAVIA governance token will be available on Decentralized Exchanges, as well as select Centralized Exchanges.</p>\n<p>NFT assets such as Land, Heroes and Statues will be sold to the public through the Mavia minting website. In the future, NFTs may be rewarded through staking programs and gameplay.</p>\n<h3>Royalties and Fee-Sharing</h3>\n<p>The development team never will take a royalty or fee from any RUBY transactions within the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the development team will not receive a royalty or fee for any NFTs exchanged on the NFT marketplace.</p>\n<p>All of the value is contained within the game ecosystem, for the benefit of the players and the&nbsp;DAO.</p>\n<p>The DAO will be able to modify these rules and may enact a fee in the future on RUBY and MAVIA transactions, but the development team will not directly benefit from this, it will always go back to the ecosystem directly in some&nbsp;form.</p>\n<h3>RUBY Burn Mechanisms</h3>\n<p>One of the primary mechanics of the game is the burning of RUBY when it is spent on in-game upgrades, skins, consumables and other utilities.</p>\n<p>The purpose of burning RUBY is not to influence its secondary market&nbsp;value.</p>\n<p>Rather, the sole purpose of burning RUBY is to balance the in-game economy which mints RUBY as a reward for players winning battles and completing achievements and milestones.</p>\n<p>Like any in-game economy, the currencies used in the game must be properly balanced in order to maintain the value of the upgrades and items sought after. This is what keeps the game fun and engaging.</p>\n<p>If there were no burn mechanism present in the game, then this means RUBY could only be minted or recycled. Both of these options present&nbsp;issues.</p>\n<p>If RUBY were only able to be minted, this means that the perceived value of in-game upgrades and consumables would gradually decrease over time, making the game less engaging and&nbsp;fun.</p>\n<p>If the RUBY collected were simply recycled to new players, this means the supply of RUBY would still suffer the same fate as the inflation scenario above, it would only be delayed as the system tries to calculate increasingly complex models to balance out the RUBY rewards for the player&nbsp;base.</p>\n<p><strong>RUBY Models:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option 1 (recycling&hairsp;—&hairsp;bad): Player earns RUBY -&gt; Player spends RUBY in-game -&gt; RUBY goes to development team to distribute/recycle to new players -&gt; Now the system is not decentralized, the fate of RUBY is in the hands of the dev team, and RUBY suffers inflation long-term</li>\n<li>Option 2 (burning&hairsp;—&hairsp;good): Player earns RUBY -&gt; Player spends RUBY in-game -&gt; RUBY spent is&nbsp;burned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option 2 is the simplest solution, and also allows Mavia to be more “trustless”, as we display every RUBY transaction that is earned/spent on the web platform for all to&nbsp;see.</p>\n<p>And again, none of the RUBY spending goes to the Mavia development team, all of it is&nbsp;burned.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the development team does not decide when to burn, and when not to burn. Just like we do not decide when to mint RUBY, and when not to mint. All minting and burning is done through gameplay and in full-control of the&nbsp;players.</p>\n<p><strong>RUBY Trading and&nbsp;Prices</strong></p>\n<p>We will never promise the players or community that RUBY will be a specific secondary market price, nor will we attempt to influence the price of the RUBY token. We want Mavia to be as decentralized as possible, so we allow players to withdraw and take ownership of their in-game assets, and RUBY happens to be one of those&nbsp;assets.</p>\n<p>With that being said, we do recognize the value of having RUBY be as stable as possible for players to enter/exit the ecosystem smoothly. Secondary markets are a major factor in this component.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we have structured the initial RUBY model to aim to be just that&hairsp;—&hairsp;as stable as possible. We do not plan to do this through influencing the secondary markets, but rather we aim to achieve this by balancing the in-game RUBY supply as much as possible, and the community/players will handle the&nbsp;rest.</p>\n<p>If the overall RUBY inflation rate is proportional to new players entering the game and the RUBY spending inside of the game economy, this will result in a net-zero&nbsp;effect.</p>\n<p>We see our priority as creating the most balanced and sustainable model we can so that the ecosystem can thrive long-term. We think this is the approach all Web3.0 games should&nbsp;take.</p>\n<h3>Speculation of MAVIA, RUBY and NFT&nbsp;Prices</h3>\n<p>As everyone is aware, the Cryptocurrency and NFT space is extremely volatile in nature. Games that involve NFTs and Cryptocurrency are by default subject to speculation and volatility, and Mavia will be no exception.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it is important for our team to state our goals and disclaimers relating to the tokens and NFT assets involved in the Mavia ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>We do not make any promises to the value of the MAVIA or RUBY currencies, nor do we make promises for the Land, Hero or Statue NFT future prices. We also do not promise a certain amount of earnings or value to be gained as a result of playing the Mavia&nbsp;game.</strong></p>\n<p>All RUBY earnings and NFT asset value gained from the game is completely dependent on the player. All speculation on Mavia or Ruby tokens is outside of our team’s&nbsp;control.</p>\n<p>The Mavia development team’s goal is to build a highly engaging game with balanced economics and a robust set of features allowing players to own and control their in-game&nbsp;assets.</p>\n<h3>Mavia’s DAO and The Path to Decentralization</h3>\n<p>Our team aims to make Mavia as decentralized as possible. We do this through making most of the web platform, smart contracts and repositories public.</p>\n<p>All blockchain related codebases will be made public. Additionally, the NFT marketplace codebase developed by our development team will be made public, allowing anyone to build and expand upon&nbsp;it.</p>\n<p>Through our public-facing APIs, all Mavia data will be retrievable by anyone looking to build third-party applications on top of the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>The codebases which are not going to be made public include sensitive game mechanics and rules which would harm the integrity of the game if it were to be made public. One day, when Web3.0 solutions for DAO control of repositories and databases becomes stable enough, we hope to make this decentralized as&nbsp;well.</p>\n<p>We also want to place key decision making rights for Mavia into the hands of the DAO, and put the fate of the game into our communities hands.</p>\n<p>We are currently developing a community voting system, which allows our team and anyone in the DAO to make proposals and vote on matters relating to the game and ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These steps we are taking are done to further increase transparency with our community, as well as place the fate of the Mavia ecosystem into our players/governance token holders&nbsp;hands.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We feel it is important to share these disclaimers with our community, as everyone want to get involved in Mavia for different reasons, and our position on secondary markets, token prices, and purchasing game assets must be addressed.</p>\n<p>We have been very vocal about our goal as a development team to create a fun and engaging game coupled with a balanced in-game economy, and we have full trust in our community and DAO to guide the ecosystem long-term.</p>\n<p>Web3.0 gaming is in its infancy, and we are all working together to learn and grow the space in order to transform gaming into a space ran and operated by the players, for the&nbsp;players.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45b109e681f1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-token-and-nft-disclaimers-45b109e681f1\">Mavia Token and NFT Disclaimers</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

All speculation on Mavia or Ruby tokens is outside of our team’s&nbsp;control.</p>\n<p>The Mavia development team’s goal is to build a highly engaging game with balanced economics and a robust set of features allowing players to own and control their in-game&nbsp;assets.</p>\n<h3>Mavia’s DAO and The Path to Decentralization</h3>\n<p>Our team aims to make Mavia as decentralized as possible. We do this through making most of the web platform, smart contracts and repositories public.</p>\n<p>All blockchain related codebases will be made public. Additionally, the NFT marketplace codebase developed by our development team will be made public, allowing anyone to build and expand upon&nbsp;it.</p>\n<p>Through our public-facing APIs, all Mavia data will be retrievable by anyone looking to build third-party applications on top of the&nbsp;game.</p>\n<p>The codebases which are not going to be made public include sensitive game mechanics and rules which would harm the integrity of the game if it were to be made public. One day, when Web3.0 solutions for DAO control of repositories and databases becomes stable enough, we hope to make this decentralized as&nbsp;well.</p>\n<p>We also want to place key decision making rights for Mavia into the hands of the DAO, and put the fate of the game into our communities hands.</p>\n<p>We are currently developing a community voting system, which allows our team and anyone in the DAO to make proposals and vote on matters relating to the game and ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These steps we are taking are done to further increase transparency with our community, as well as place the fate of the Mavia ecosystem into our players/governance token holders&nbsp;hands.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We feel it is important to share these disclaimers with our community, as everyone want to get involved in Mavia for different reasons, and our position on secondary markets, token prices, and purchasing game assets must be addressed.</p>\n<p>We have been very vocal about our goal as a development team to create a fun and engaging game coupled with a balanced in-game economy, and we have full trust in our community and DAO to guide the ecosystem long-term.</p>\n<p>Web3.0 gaming is in its infancy, and we are all working together to learn and grow the space in order to transform gaming into a space ran and operated by the players, for the&nbsp;players.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45b109e681f1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia/mavia-token-and-nft-disclaimers-45b109e681f1\">Mavia Token and NFT Disclaimers</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/heroes-of-mavia\">Heroes of Mavia</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",
